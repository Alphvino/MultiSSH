# MultiSSH
⚠️ I don't assume any responsability. The software in this repository is provided without any warranty. If you decide to run this, you fully understand what it does and everything caused by it is completely your fault.<br>

Control multiple servers by connecting with SSH and sending commands to them.
Useful when it's needed to run a command in multiple servers, as an example it can be required to run "uptime" command in all servers to monitor their uptime. <br>
It's an alternative to ansible, that in my opinion, isn't that easy to configure in all servers. <br>
